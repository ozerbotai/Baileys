## New versions
- If you want to start off a different branch of the original repo, create a new branch with the content of that branch, and make the new branch the default branch on github.

- Make Ozer use your local version of this library and test the changes.
  - On Ozer dir run `npx link pathToBaseDirWhereYouCloneGithubRepos/baileys`. 
    - This won't change its `package.json`
    - It will replace the downloaded release version in `ozer/node_modules/@ozerbotai/baileys/` for a symlink to `pathToBaseDirWhereYouCloneGithubRepos/baileys`.
    - Baileys dependencies were downloaded into `ozer/node_modules` during `npm install`. TODO: if baileys local version changed its dependencies, find a way to test the updated dependencies.
  - Run Ozer and make sure everything works fine.
  - Run `npm install` to revert `npx link pathToBaseDirWhereYouCloneGithubRepos/baileys`.
